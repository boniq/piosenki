My girl, my girl
don't lie to me
tell me where
did you sleep last night

in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
i would shiver
the whole night through

my girl, my girl
where will you go
i'm going
where the cold wind blows

in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
i would shiver
the whole night through

her husband was a hard working man
just about a mile from here
his head was found in a driving wheel
but his body never was found

my girl, my girl
don't lie to me
tell me where
did you sleep last night

in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
i would shiver
the whole night through

my girl, my girl
where will you go
i'm going
where the cold wind blows

in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
i would shiver
the whole night through

my girl, my girl
don't lie to me
tell me where
did you sleep last night

in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
i would shiver
the whole night through

my girl, my girl
where will you go
i'm going
where the cold wind blows

in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
i would shiver
the whole night through
