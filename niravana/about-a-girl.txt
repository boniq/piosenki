I need an easy friend
I do... with a hand to lend
I do... think you fit this shoe
I do... but you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hear me out to dry
But I can't see you every night for free

I'm standing in your line
I do... hope you have the time
I do... pick a number two
I do... to keep a date with you
