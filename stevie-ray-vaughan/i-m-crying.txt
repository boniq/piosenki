Well, I'm sittin' here so lonely, feelin' oh so blue
My baby's tryin' to mistreat me and I don't know what to do
So I'm cryin' Why do I have to feel this way?
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day

Yeah, I've loved her for such a long time, to end it all this way
Sittin' here so lonely, tears keep fallin' just like rain
So I'm cryin' Why do I have to feel this way?
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day

Yeah, you know I love you baby, I'll do anything for you
But when we start to fightin' I just get these same old blues
So I'm cryin' Why do I have to feel this way?
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day

Yeah, now when I first met you baby at a dance and we did fine
But now that we're together, yeah it's a total waste of time
And so I'm cryin' Why do I have to feel this way?
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day

Well, I guess it's just my own fault, the truth I cannot hide
But if I ever get you back dear, I'll stay right by your side
I won't be cryin' I'll stay happy that way.
I'll be lovin' my little baby every night and every day
