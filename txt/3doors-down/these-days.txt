I think i was better off before this all began
So clearly i can see lately that you don't know who i am
Everybody tried to tell me something that i never could believe
Stand back it seems so much different than it did in front of me
But i know

There's no good in lookin' back on yesterday
And wondering what could have happened then
You think you can give me what i want
You say, you say
I think i'm better off alone
These days, these days

Why should i put my trust in something that i never could believe
So one day you can find somethin better just to pack your things and leave
Loneliness is a friend for the moment but you won't walk out on me
I know

There's no good in lookin' back on yesterday
And wondering what could have happened then
You think you can give me what i want
You say, you say
I think i'm better off alone
These days, these days

I'm tired and i'm sick of waiting
Maybe i'll die alone
'cause i can't take another damn day
Of waiting here for you to come home to me
Yeah, yeah, baby, baby please
Tell me why

You think you can give me what i want
You say, you say
I think i'm better off alone
These days, these days
You think you can give me what i want
You say, you say
I think i'm better off alone
These days, these days
