Well it's floodin' down in Texas....All of the telephone lines are down
Well it's floodin' down in Texas....All of the telephone lines are down
And I've been tryin' to call my baby....Lord and I can't get a single sound

Well dark clouds are rollin' in....Man I'm standin' out in the rain
Well dark clouds are rollin' in....Man I'm standin' out in the rain
Yeah flood water keep a rollin'....Man it's about to drive poor me insane

Well I'm leavin' you baby....Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay
Well I'm leavin' you baby....Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay

Well back home ain't no floods and tornados....Baby the sun shines on me every day
