Well you've heard about love
Givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine
She's my sweet little thang
She's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my baby....Heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thang
She's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my lady
She's long and lean
You mess with her
You'll see a man get mean
She's my sweet little thang
She's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Well I love my baby
Like the finest wine
Stick with her until the end of time
She's my sweet little thang
She's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my baby
Heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thang
She's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy
