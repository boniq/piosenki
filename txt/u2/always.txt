Here today, gone tomorrow
 Crack the bone, get to the marrow
 To be a bee and the flower
 Before the sweetness turns to sour

 What we have we're gonna keep, always
 What we've lost we don't need, always
 What is it that won't let you sleep, always

 Be the arrow and the target
 Put your head over the parapet
 Be uncool, be awkward
 Don't look in the obvious place
 The soul needs beauty for a soulmate

 Get down off your holy cloud, always
 God will not deal with the proud, always
 Well if you dream then dream out loud, always
 Eternally yours, always

 I want you
 I want you
 I want you

 Know what to do yourself, always
 Go find yourself in someone else, always
 And always wear a safety belt, always
 Wait for me I'm running late, always
 This is the moment that we share for always
 Turning slowly into a prayer, always

 Now and forever
 For always,
