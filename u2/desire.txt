DESIRE
 Lover I'm off the street
 Gonna go where the bright lights
 And the big city meet
 With a red guitar, on fire
 Desire
 She's the candle burning in my room
 I'm like the needle, needle and spoon
 Over the counter with a shotgun
 Pretty soon, everybody got one
 And the fever when I'm beside her
 Desire, desire
 She's the dollars
 She's my protection
 Yeah she's a promise
 In the year of election
 Sister, I can't let you go
 I'm like a preacher stealing hearts
 At a travelling show
 For love or money, money... ?
 [And the fever, is getting higher]
 Desire
